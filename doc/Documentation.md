## DoublyLinkedList
Implementation: [my implementation](../src/nl/saxion/cds/data_structures/DoublyLinkedList.java);

Implementing a doubly linked list was the assignment of the first week to get a fresh reminder of the basic data structures.
In the last year, I was lucky to have taken a course "Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures" where I already implemented both Singly, Doubly and Circular linked list structures, which helped me to get started quickly.
I have rewritten most of the code myself, but it is still very much similar to my previous implementation.
I was confused with method `remove()` at first, as it wasn't clear if it should remove the first encountered element or all of them. Therefore, I have made it remove only the first encounter, but I have also added a method `removeAll()` which removes all occurrences of the given element.

I have had some troubles with `graphViz()` method as I have never used `DOT` language before. 
After spending some time reading the documentation and still not being able to visualize the nodes, I began to surf through internet. 
I stumbled upon a stack overflow post where I found a script for visualizing doubly linked list.
After that I have used chatGPT to achieve getting same script output based on elements inside my list.

When it comes to testing, I went a bit overboard and tested every method with multiple test cases, including edge cases.
I have achieved 100% coverage just out of curiosity, but I believe it was a good practice to do so.
